				<h2>Becoming a coder</h2>
				<div class="history-events">

						<li>
						I studied Environmental Science and GIS at UCCS. In my last few semesters, I realized I wanted to code. I took 3 semesters of programming courses and through my journey, I decided web development was my favorite.
						</li>
						<li>
						After I graduated, I began to teach myself some basics about front end development to get a feel for how it really worked. I realized at this rate though, the evolution of the market was outpacing my learning speed.
						</li>
						<li>
						I decided I needed to look into some programming courses and came across a variety of technical schools in the Denver area dedicated to web development. After looking into a couple different school choices, I decided to get involved with a school called RefactorU and took my first step into becoming a web developer.
						</li>
						<li>
						Once I graduated from RefactorU, I freelanced for a year, picking up random gigs and tutoring. A more stable source of income presented itself, and I joined small company down in Colorado Springs. During my time there, I gained some professional experience in a cozy work place.
						</li>
						<li>
						I currently reside at the Colorado Springs Gazette as a Junior Developer. The environment is fast pace and has given me multiple opportunities to learn valuable skills, such as cross browser usability, deploying sites and project management.

					<h3>I'm always trying to find new and exciting adventures to keep me active.</h3>

							</div>
							<div class="activity-images activity-image-second">
								<p>
									It's a new hobby, I love the cosplay community. Last year, I had the pleasure of attending Denver Comic Con as a War Boy. I even got in to see Stan Lee discuss building the Marvel empire and creating iconic characters such as Spiderman and Iron Man.
								</p>

								<p>
									Climbing takes up most of my time. I love to get outside and explore new places of climbing. Although I am terrified of heights, the way I see it, life is about getting out of your comfort zone. Climbing forces me to push myself to test my boundaries and keeps me active.
								</p>

								<p>
									I have been blessed with the means to be have been skiing since I could walk. Every year I enjoy hitting the slopes and taking advantage of the incredible winters we have in our square state.

							</div>
							<div class="activity-images activity-image-second">
								<p>
									When I can't ski on snow, I ski on water. My friends have a piece of land on a lake, a boat and beer. When you mix them together, it makes for a lot of fantastic adventures during the summer. I maybe the runt of this group, but I can still hold my own on a slalom course... sometimes.

								<p>
									The obvious one! If I'm not outside, I enjoy coding. I try hard to work on my own projects, but I also get involved with community events and talks. I've attended Develop Denver, Go Code Colorado Springs and Global Game Jam so far. I look forward to the many more to come.

									Hiking through Colorado has been exhilerating and visually stimulating. There is never a dull sight when exploring our backyard. My most difficult climb to date was Capitol Peak, but I hope for it to be only one of many class 4 climbs I will accomplish.
